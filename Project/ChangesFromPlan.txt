Changes from plan
Weapon class now has an abstract function render (didn't know you had to render the texture in SFML)
Semi and Auto now handle the rending instead of firning (learned how rendering and fire calcs work)

Changed which weapons I have (just found better assets for the shotgun and MG)

Bullet class removed (decided having an actual bullet entity would be unnecesarily hard
                      firing now handled by the shotgun, pistol, and MG classes)

Player and Hostile classes no longer inherit from entity class (Players aren't really entities they're more of a camera)

RayCastingEngine holds rays instead of entities (removed entity, also the engine uses the rays so it just works better)

Removed Texture class (Textured walls was just to hard, Textures now done by RayCastingEngine, just colours though)
